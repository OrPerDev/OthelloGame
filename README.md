<font size = "4">About The Game</font>

The game is a re-creation of Othello (Reversi game) using C# .Net Core 3 and Winforms.
Othello is an abstract strategy board game invented during the Victorian era.
Othello involves play by two parties on an eight-by-eight square grid with pieces that have two distinct sides. Pieces typically appear coin-like, with a light and a dark face, each side representing one player. The goal for each player is to make pieces of their colour constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game, by turning over as many of their opponent's pieces as possible.
In this case the players can also choose to play "Mini-Othello" where the board is six-by-six board.
